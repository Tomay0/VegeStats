# Vegebot Statistics Web Application

This application is to be used along side the discord bot: [Vegebot](https://github.com/Tomay0/VegeBot)

## Run in docker

You can run this fairly easily through docker compose.

You should include a .env file containing some environment variables.

These include:

* APP_PORT: The port number (ideally 80)
* POSTGREST_URL: The URL to the postgREST API
* POSTGREST_TOKEN: The authentication token for the postgREST API

```bash
docker-compose run --build
```

## Displaying stats

To display stats for a server go to http://your_url/stats/discord_server_id to display statistics.

This URL can be generated by going into a server with vegebot and typing

```
vege stats
```
